# Personal Website for my Developer Journey

Site Link: https://benbeaver.dev


## Pages
Includes Home, About page, Portfolio, and Contact which is pretty bare but will be updated to fit what is applicable for projects

## Eventual Updates
At some point I will incorporate a blog, at the moment I just used object notation and a generated template. Obviously this won't suffice, so the next step is Authorization and a baseline content management system.

### Scale
Given the fact that I've had the privilege to learn Express.JS but haven't used it much recently, I think the most likely progression is to meld Express/Node into this.

### DNS, and Deployment Experimentation
I've been able to learn a lot about a recent progress (one that is displayed on my website.) This turned out to be motivating to me because I recently how cheap it is to deploy my own website, on my own domain, but I find that the way I'm deploying is inefficent, (I have love for you Netlify, but it's likely there is a better way.)
